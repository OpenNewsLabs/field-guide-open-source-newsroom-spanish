# The Field Guide to Open Source in the Newsroom

Journalists who work with code know how open-source projects pay off. When we share tools that solve common problems, we work faster and spend more time covering the news. Releasing projects to the public puts more eyes on our code, and makes it better.

Doing that work isn't easy, though. Newsroom deadlines often don't leave time for cleanup and documentation, much less the planning that leads to reusable code. In newsrooms where open source isn't the norm, it can be hard to make the case for "giving away" your work. A common set of cultural and technical questions come up before, during, and after every open-source release-but as a community we don't have a common pool of answers.

But we can build one together.

## About this Guide

This guidebook collects the advice and experience of dozens of newsroom developers and technologists, covering the entire open-sourcing process—from starting a project to handoffs and sunsets—in the context of journalism. It's a collaborative resource that will continue to grow. We'd love to have you contribute, and [share the great work you're doing](docs/contributing.md) with the rest of the journalism-code community.

The guidebook is hosted by [OpenNews](https://opennews.org/), a team that helps developers, designers, and data analysts convene and collaborate on open journalism projects. The first draft was written during [a two-day event in December 2016](https://source.opennews.org/articles/building-guide-open-sourcing-newsroom-code/), with about 20 people working in-person and remote.

## More Resources

The Field Guide to Open Source in the Newsroom is written by people who care about journalism, specifically to address the cultural and technical challenges faced by developers who work in newsrooms. There are other wonderful guidebooks to open-sourcing

* ["Producing Open Source Software"](http://producingoss.com/) by Karl Fogel

There's also a companion tool to this guidebook. Open Project Linter is an automated checklist you can use to test project directories for good practices in documentation and code. (And it's an open-source project you can contribute to as well!)
